When we trigger the request, your browser first performs a DNS lookup to find the server's IP address and establishes a secure connection via a TLS handshake. Once connected, it sends a GET request containing specific headers that define what it can handle. The server processes this request, checks for the resource, and sends back a 200 OK status code along with the response headers and the HTML payload. Finally, the browser receives this data, closes the connection and begins parsing the code to display the website.
